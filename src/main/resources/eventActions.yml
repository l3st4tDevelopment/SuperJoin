## This is the event actions configuration file.
## A list of available actions can be found here:
## https://github.com/l3st4tPlugins/ActionAPI

## These are global actions that will be executed no matter what.
global:
  joinActions:
    - '[Message] <green>Welcome to my server!'
  quitActions:
    - '[Broadcast] <red>%player left us. Big sad.'


## These actions will be executed on join for new players.
firstJoinActions:
  - '[Broadcast] <green>%player has joined for the first time!'

## These actions rely on permissions. If a player doesn't have permission
## for any group, only the global actions will be executed, along with first
## join actions if applicable.
groups:
  ## This can be anything, as long as it is unique.
  ## The permission for this would be: superjoin.groups.default
  default:
    ## Specify the priority here. Lower number = higher priority.
    priority: 0
    ## You can specify join actions here.
    joinActions:
      - '[Broadcast] <green>%player <yellow>has joined the server!'
      - '[Sound] BLOCK_BELL_USE'
    ## You can specify quit actions here.
    ## Some actions are kind of useless since the player is leaving.
    quitActions:
      - '[Broadcast] <green>%player <red>has left the server!'
      - '[Sound] ENTITY_VILLAGER_NO'
